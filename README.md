# E-commerce Node.js

## Description
Secure E-commerce website with Node.js, Express js, and Mongoose.



## Run
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Set up environmental variables:
   Create a file named `.env` at the root of the project and add the following lines to it:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_uri>
   JWT_SEC =<your_JWT_secret>
   STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_stripe_private_key>
   ```
   Replace `<your_mongo_uri>`, `<your_JWT_secret>`, and `<your_stripe_private_key>` with the appropriate values you obtained for your MongoDB Atlas database, JWT secret, and Stripe private API key respectively.

2. Navigate to the "DB" folder:
   Go to the "DB" folder in the project directory, and you'll find files related to your MongoDB database.

3. Fill your MongoDB Atlas database:
   Use the files in the "DB" folder to populate your MongoDB Atlas database with the required data for the application to function correctly.

4. Install dependencies:
   Open a terminal or command prompt in the root of the project directory, and run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the application:
   After the installation is complete, run the following command in the terminal to start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

Now the application should be up and running. You can access it through your browser at the specified URL 
```(usually http://localhost:3000)```. 
Make sure your MongoDB Atlas database is properly connected, and you can interact with the application.
